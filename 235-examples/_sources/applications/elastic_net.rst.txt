Elastic net model selection
===========================

A canonical and highly practical application of this theory is hyperparameter optimization for the **Elastic Net**. The elastic net objective combines L1 and L2 regularization parameterized by two coefficients: :math:`\lambda` (overall strength) and :math:`\alpha` (L1/L2 balance). When appropriately parameterized, these coefficients span a 2-simplex.

Because the elastic net problem is unconstrained and strongly convex, it is guaranteed to be weakly simplicial :cite:p:`mizota2021unconstrained`. Furthermore, as established by :cite:t:`bonnel2019post`, optimal parameter tuning for the Elastic Net can be rigorously formulated as optimization over the Pareto set of a convex multi-objective problem. The L2 penalty enforces strong convexity, guaranteeing that the underlying solution is unique for each parameter combination, enabling well-defined sensitivity analysis and path-following algorithms.

Rather than training thousands of models in a grid search over all :math:`(\lambda, \alpha)` combinations, you can train the Elastic Net on a sparse subset of simplex-structured weight vectors. Fitting a Bézier simplex to the resulting trained models yields a continuous performance surface. This allows practitioners to instantly explore the full continuous spectrum of model hyperparameters and locate the statistically optimal model analytically, without any further retraining.


Weighted-sum scalarization and solution map
-------------------------------------------

The *weighted-sum scalarization* :math:`x^*: \Delta^{M-1}\to\mathbb R^N` defined by

.. math:: x^*(w)=\arg\min_x \sum_{m=1}^M w_m f_m(x).

We define the *solution map* :math:`(x^*,f\circ x^*):\Delta^{M-1}\to G^*(f)` by

.. math:: (x^*,f\circ x^*)(w)=(x^*(w),f(x^*(x))).

The solution map is continuous and surjective.
See :cite:p:`mizota2021unconstrained` for technical details.
