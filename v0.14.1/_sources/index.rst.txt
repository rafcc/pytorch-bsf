Welcome to PyTorch-BSF!
=======================

**Fit smooth, high-dimensional manifolds to your data — from a single GPU to a multi-node cluster.**

PyTorch-BSF brings `Bézier simplex fitting`_ to PyTorch.
A Bézier simplex is a high-dimensional generalization of the Bézier curve: it can model an arbitrarily complex point cloud as a smooth parametric hyper-surface in any number of dimensions.
This makes it a natural tool for representing **Pareto fronts** in multi-objective optimization, interpolating scattered observations, and fitting geometric structures in high-dimensional spaces.

The project is on `GitHub`_.
